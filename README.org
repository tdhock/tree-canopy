** Tree canopy estimation project

Can optimal changepoint models help predict/determine canopy height?

The commands required to re-make the figures are documented in
[[file:Makefile]], e.g. type =make w34_testData-figure.png= on the command
line to re-make that figure.

[[file:packages.R]] should be automatically run in order to install the
required packages.
